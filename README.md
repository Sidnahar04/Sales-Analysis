• Increase stores where household incomes are higher and count of stores is less.Decrease stores in those locations where we have more stores and less household income.

• Company should think to expand in some regions like Midwest and Northeast before they move their business to Overseas.

• As online is 2nd in position in generating sales and Profits then company should work on digital marketing strategies and increase sales online this will also help in cost cutting as less man Power is used.
